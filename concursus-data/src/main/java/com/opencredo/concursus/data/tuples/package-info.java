/**
 * Implements the fundamental "named tuple" data model for Concursus command and event parameters. This model bridges
 * between the persistence layer and the Java type system, by providing a representation of an ordered collection of
 * named and typed values, corresponding to method parameters, that is decoupled from Java's reflection methods.
